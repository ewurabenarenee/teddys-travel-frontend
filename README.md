# Teddy's Travels Frontend

Teddy's Travel is a web application that helps you to plan and organize trips. This is the frontend part of the service which I developed as part of my coding bootcamp at [Code Labs Academy](https://codelabsacademy.com/).

## How to run this application

If this is your first time running the application, install dependencies using

```sh
npm i
```

To start the development server, run

```
npm run dev
```

The application should now be available under `http://localhost:3000`.

**Please note that this is currently just a prototype, no functionality or data persistance have been implemented yet!**
