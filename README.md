# Teddy's Travels Frontend

Teddy's Travel is a web application that helps you to plan and organize trips. This is the frontend part of the service which I developed as part of my coding bootcamp at [Code Labs Academy](https://codelabsacademy.com/).

## How to run this application

If this is your first time running the application, install dependencies using

```sh
npm i
```

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`.

To start the development server, run

```
npm run dev
```

The application should now be available under `http://localhost:3000`.
